## How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
To ensure that my code, program, or software is funciton and secure, it's important to follow general programming guidelines. The guidelines mainly include code quality and secure development. Caution is extremely important when coding to ensure that errors don't occur where they're not supposed to.
## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Interpretting user needs is pretty simple. First, you want to find the general purpose of the system. Then you need to see how that system interacts with the user and its requirements. Next, picking the use cases for the user actor allows us to understand and incorporate them into the generalized system.
## How do I approach designing software?
Designing software should be a linear progression. You should always start with gathering the requirements for the system. Next, you should implement a diagram that shows how the general actions of the system interact with each other. After, creating UML diagrams to expand on the use cases of the heirarchial diagram will ensure that the design is correct and works well within the system.
